/*

Question set / Game state

Information is organized by question.
Each question can have multiple answers.
The "live" properties indicate which answers (and therefore, questions) are in play

This JSON specifically, is only used for starting a game.
Once a game is started and saved, the instance JSON is saved (game state) to the journal.
